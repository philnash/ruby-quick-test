# Ruby Quick Test

Run your ruby test files from within [Atom](http://atom.io). Inspired by [Sublime Test Ruby-Test](https://github.com/maltize/sublime-text-2-ruby-tests).

## Installing

Use the Atom package manager, which can be found in the Settings view or run apm install ruby-quick-test from the command line.

## Usage

Ruby Quick Test can be used to quickly run a test file with a file name that matches the pattern `/_test\.rb$/`. When the active editor is such a file, you can run the tests with the key combination `cmd-ctrl-t` or by using the command palette (`cmd-shift-p`).

This currently doesn't cover Rspec or MiniTest::Spec style files, but support is planned for those soon.

### Commands

* `cmd-ctrl-t` - Run the current test file
* `cmd-ctrl-e` - Re-run the previous test file
* `cmd-ctrl-x` - Show/hide the test panel

## RVM

If you are using RVM then you need to make sure Atom is loaded via env so that it has access to your `$PATH`. Otherwise you will get an error like `execvp(): No such file or directory`.

	vim `which atom`

Change:

	open -a $ATOM_PATH -n --args --executed-from="$(pwd)" --pid=$$ $@

to:

	env open -a $ATOM_PATH -n --args --executed-from="$(pwd)" --pid=$$ $@

## Todo

* Tests!
* Rspec/MiniTest::Spec support
* [Issues/pull requests](https://github.com/philnash/ruby-quick-test/issues) welcome
